# mueller-sph
A concise 2D implementation of Müller's "Particle-Based Fluid Simulation for Interactive Applications" (SPH) [paper](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/sca03.pdf) in C++

See [here](https://github.com/cerrno/mueller-sph-rs) for a more recent implementation in Rust including a parallel solver

Please see the accompanying [tutorial](https://lucasschuermann.com/writing/implementing-sph-in-2d) for more information.
